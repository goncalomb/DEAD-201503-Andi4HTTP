Andi4HTTP
=========

A neat directory index for HTTP.

Now with basic theme support. Icons and Markdown headers/footers planned.

Installing
----------

Andi4HTTP is for Apache only.

**For now it only works if installed on the root of your domain.**

1. Copy the contents of `www` into the directory that you want to enable listing.
2. Navigate to that directory on the browser.
3. Wait 0.001 seconds. It will automatically create all the required `.htaccess` files.
4. Done.
5. (Optional) Tweak the configuration file `_andi4http\config.php` to your liking.
