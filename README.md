Andi4HTTP
=========

A neat directory index for HTTP.

Installing
----------

Andi4HTTP is for Apache

**For now it only works if installed on the root of your domain.**

1. Copy the contents of `www` into the directory that you want to enable listing.
2. Navigate to that directory on the browser.
3. Wait 0.001 seconds. It will automatically create all the required `.htaccess` files.
4. Done.
