The '_andi4http' directory
==========================

Everyting that is important to render the directory listing is here.

You can change some stuff like the `config.php` file.

Once the `.htaccess` is created, this directory will be locked to the outside and not listed.

The 'core' directory (don't edit)
---------------------------------

Contains the core files of the project. As a user, you don't need edit these.

The 'config.php' file (DO edit)
-------------------------------

The configuration file. Go wild.

The 'global' directory (DO edit)
--------------------------------

Contains the global PHP templates for the header and footer, shown on every directory.

The 'themes' directory (DO edit)
--------------------------------

The themes directory, put your themes here. Or just use the default ones.
Choose your theme on the `config.php` file.
